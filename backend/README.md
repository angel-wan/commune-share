**Database Schema Design:**

1. **Users:**
   - You should have a "Users" collection to store user information. Each document in this collection can contain user details like username, email, password (hashed and salted for security), and other profile information.

```javascript
{
   _id: ObjectId("user_id"),
   username: "john_doe",
   email: "john.doe@example.com",
   password: "hashed_password",
   // Other user profile information
}
```

2. **Events:**
   - Create an "Events" collection to store information about events created by users. Each event document should contain details such as the event name, description, location, and other relevant data.

```javascript
{
   _id: ObjectId("event_id"),
   name: "Birthday Party",
   description: "Join us for a fun birthday celebration.",
   location: "123 Main St, City",
   // Other event details
}
```

3. **Event Participants:**
   - To manage the collaboration aspect, you can create a "Participants" sub-collection within the "Events" collection. This sub-collection will list all users participating in a specific event.

```javascript
{
   event_id: ObjectId("event_id"),
   user_id: ObjectId("user_id"),
   // Other participant information (e.g., their voting preferences, RSVP status, etc.)
}
```

4. **Event Time Slots:**
   - To support event scheduling with voting, you can create an "EventTimeSlots" sub-collection within the "Events" collection. This sub-collection can store different time slots for each event, and users can vote for their preferred time.

```javascript
{
   event_id: ObjectId("event_id"),
   start_time: ISODate("event_start_time"),
   end_time: ISODate("event_end_time"),
   votes: [ObjectId("user_id1"), ObjectId("user_id2"), ...],
   // Other time slot information
}
```

5. **Expenses:**
   - Create an "Expenses" collection to track expenses related to events. Each document in this collection should include information about the expense, the event it's associated with, and the users involved in the expense.

```javascript
{
   _id: ObjectId("expense_id"),
   event_id: ObjectId("event_id"),
   description: "Dinner at a restaurant",
   amount: 100.00,
   participants: [
      { user_id: ObjectId("user_id1"), paid: 50.00 },
      { user_id: ObjectId("user_id2"), paid: 50.00 },
   ],
   // Other expense details
}
```

**Database Architecture:**

Your application can interact with MongoDB using a server or a cloud-based database service. It's essential to use an appropriate MongoDB driver for your programming language (e.g., Mongoose for Node.js). Ensure that your application follows a structured architecture, such as the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern or similar, to separate concerns and manage the database operations efficiently.

To interact with MongoDB from your application, you'll typically use CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage user data, events, time slots, participants, and expenses. Make sure to handle database interactions securely, validate user input, and implement access control and authentication to protect your data.

In summary, this database schema and architecture provide a foundation for your web application that allows users to create, schedule, and manage events with collaboration and expense tracking features. It's crucial to adapt this structure to your specific application requirements and business logic. Additionally, don't forget to handle data validation, security, and error handling in your application code.
